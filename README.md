## At a glance ##
Datarobot for Android is a lightweight framework, which frees you from the burden of dealing with Androids SQLite database directly if you don't want to and let's you access it directly if you have to.

With an annotation based approach you are able to get a database up and running in no time. Simply annotate your data classes and let Datarobot do the work.


## Features ##
 * [Annotation based implementation](https://github.com/arconsis/datarobot/wiki/Annotations)
 * No hard coded Strings anywhere
 * Code generation for the ceremonial tasks
 * Compile time protection when renaming fields or tables
 * Fall back to Android default API is always possible
