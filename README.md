=========

## At a glance ##
Datarobot for Android is a lightweight framework, which frees you from the burden of dealing with the Android SQLite database directly if you don't want to but lets you access it directly if you need to.

With an annotation based approach you are able to get a database up and running in no time. Simply annotate your data classes and let Datarobot do the work.


## Features ##
 * [Annotation based implementation](https://github.com/arconsis/datarobot/wiki/Annotations)
 * No hard coded Strings in your code
 * Code generation for the ceremonial tasks
 * Compile time protection when renaming fields or tables
 * Fall back to Android default API is always possible
